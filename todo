GLOBAL:
	- separate out common code for server/client to a library

SERVER:
	- I dont think were disconnecting from a game/lobby when we're joining
	- bad socket handle when client disconnects
	an other one
	Error handling in binary encoding
		- at least dont crash...
	Handle game rules correctly:
	- boosting requires non isolated region
		- check this via path finding
	- when transferring to enemy (natural as well?) cells, they have to be adjacent
	Collect game and server statistics
		- server bytes io/s
		- meassure latency
		- measure game update time
	send deltas instead of whole map to observers
	have some type of verification on turn commital:
		otherwise one could just spam server with commands, which will fuck up the game state

VISUALIZE:
	colors switch when someone is eliminated
	admin mode
		- pause game
		- force game state

REFACTOR:
	the way knockouts are handeled is really bad.
		- has to do with way players are stored i think
	separate network code in server

PYTHON INTERFACE:
	- you can call c-functions from native python, should I?
