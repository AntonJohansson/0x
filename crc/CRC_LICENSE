Legal/copyright information

All the code I put into SNIPPETS for distribution is Public Domain or free to the best that I can determine. What this means is that:

    I know or can contact the original author(s) to verify the presumed copyright ownership, and

    The work bears an explicit Public Domain notice, or

    The work is copyrighted but includes a free use license, or

    The work was published without a copyright notice prior to the effective date of the new copyright law in 1988.

This has been occasionally annoying when I've had to pass up some useful piece of code because it's questionable whether anyone can use it without incurring liability (distributing someone else's property makes me an accessory to infringement).

Since SNIPPETS includes both public domain and free code, be sure to carefully read each header for any free license restrictions which may apply.

Portions of SNIPPETS are from my own MicroFirm Function Library (MFL). These are provided for free, subject to the license restrictions specified in the LICENSE.MFL file. Briefly, it says you can use the source files to create programs for any use, even commercial distribution, but you can't sell the source itself or object files (alone or in libraries) built from the source, nor can you remove the copyright notice.

Sharp-eyed users will note that the pages of this web site each carry a copyright notice. This simply means that the web pages used to navigate this site as well as instructional text are copyrighted. The code remains free!
